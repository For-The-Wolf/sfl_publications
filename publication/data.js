Clear scientific evidence supporting the safety of such a return is not currently available.",

Students, the vast majority of whom move away from home to go to university, returned to their out-of-term (family) addresses in most cases[2].After the Easter holidays, most universities began teaching and examining both undergraduate and taught graduate  students  online. There  have,  however, been  concerns raised  by the  NUS  (National Union of Students) that this switch to online teaching would disproportionally affect disadvantaged and disabled students[3]."

                "Body": "In  a  survey  conducted  by the Office  for Students in  2019, 14%  of  students  in England declared  at least one disability, this figure is likely to be an underestimate[4]. Much of the study support available to  disabled  students  has  been  harder  to deliver  duringthe  pandemic, such  as use  of note  takers[4]. Students with mental health issues have also seen their conditions exasperated by the lockdown[5]. Whether  or  not universities  return, concerns  around  loneliness  are  likely  to  remain  an issue  whilst social distancing restrictions are in place. Additionally,  the  most disadvantaged students in  the UK may  not  have access  to  the appropriate devices and broadband speeds to facilitate effective online working[6]. They may also not have the supportive  home  environment  needed  to  support  learning. Many universities tried  to  mitigate  this through a ‘no detriment’ policy  where in students were guaranteed results  at  least  as  good as  their previous  grades. However,this  is  clearlyonly  a short-termsolution to what  is  likely  to  become  an ongoing problem."

                "Body": "Despite universities continuing to teach throughout  the  lockdown,  many  students felt  that  this teaching was inadequate, leading to the NUS to call for areimbursement of tuition fees[8]. University teaching staff often had to move to online teaching with very little if any training[9]. This has led to a huge increase in academics’ workloads, with manyfeeling uncomfortable deliveringteaching onlinewith the resources available to them at their institution. The University sector is predicted to accrue lossesin the range£3-£19bn[10]. This is primarily due to a reduced  number  of international students,  aloss  of  revenue  in  lockdown due  to  students  leaving accommodation early, and postponing of conferences[10]."

                "Body": "Most undergraduate students are under 25[11] and therefore have a much lower risk of serious illness resulting from COVID-19[12]. Many staff,however,are much older and may belong to groups that have a much larger risk of serious illness from contracting COVID-19[12].  The long-term effects of COVID-19 are still unknown, and much more research is needed[13]. Furthermore, some students will have long-term health conditions, which meansthey themselves mayneed to continue shielding for some time."
